;; Thinking recursively
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; You're likely already familiar with the basics of recursion, and as a result you can take heart that we won't force
;; you to read a beginner's tutorial again. But because recursive solutions are prevalent in Clojure code, it's
;; important for us to cover it well enough that you can fully understand Clojure's recursive offerings.

;; Recursion is often viewed as a low-level operation reserved for times when solutions involving higher-order functions
;; either fail or lead to obfuscation. Granted, it's fun to solve problems recursively because even for those of us
;; who've attained some level of acumen with functional programming, finding a recursive solution still injects a bit of
;; magic into our day. Recursion is a perfect building block for creating higher-level looping constructs and functions,
;; as we'll show in this section.
